The Da Vinci DTR Test Kit Light EHR Suite validates the conformance of SMART apps
to the STU 2 version of the HL7® FHIR®
[Da Vinci Documentation Templates and Rules (DTR) Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-dtr/STU2/).

## Scope

These tests are a **DRAFT** intended to allow app implementers to perform
preliminary checks of their systems against DTR IG requirements and [provide
feedback](https://github.com/inferno-framework/davinci-dtr-test-kit/issues)
on the tests. Future versions of these tests may validate other requirements and may change the test validation logic.

## Test Methodology

TBD.

## Running the Tests

## Limitations

The DTR IG is a complex specification and these tests currently validate conformance to only
a subset of IG requirements. Future versions of the test suite will test further
features. A few specific features of interest are listed below.
